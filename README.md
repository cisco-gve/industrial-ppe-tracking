# Using the WiFi to reduce risk in industrial envinronments



### Problem
Industrial environments can be dangerous. 

Implementing and monitoring safety policies to keep employees safe in these environments is traditionally costly and time-intensive. 


### Solution!
Our solution targets Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) safety policies in the workplace. Using this solution, Operations Managers can easily define the PPE requirements for specific areas, for example ear protection on the manufacturing floor, or a vest and hat in the warehouse.

Once this policy is defined, existing WiFi infrastructure can be used to track individual employees as they enter a high-risk area. The previously defined PPE can also be tracked to ensure it is present on the employee. 

If the employee has not brought their PPE into the area or if they remove it for a significant amount of time, operations will be alerted.
